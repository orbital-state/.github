# Orbital-State: Revolutionizing Infrastructure-as-Code Management

Welcome to **Orbital-State**, the innovative DevOps framework designed to elevate your infrastructure management to new heights. Bridging the gap between the declarative power of Terraform and the operational flexibility of Crossplane, Orbital-State introduces a groundbreaking approach to handling complex infrastructure configurations through a distributed architecture of "orbital" microservices.

## Key Features

### Distributed Configuration Management
Orbital-State enables organizations to decompose intricate Terraform configurations into manageable pieces. This modular approach allows teams to distribute the responsibility of infrastructure management across various microservices, simplifying the development, maintenance, and scaling of large-scale systems.

### Eventual Consistency & State Synchronization
Embracing the principle of eventual consistency, our framework ensures that all distributed components eventually reflect the desired state of your infrastructure. Orbital-State's intelligent synchronization process aligns resource configurations across your environment, providing a cohesive and up-to-date view of your infrastructure's state.

### Drift Detection & Self-Healing
Drawing inspiration from the resilient deployment models of Flux and Kubernetes, Orbital-State possesses the ability to detect configuration drifts automatically. More impressively, it endeavors to self-heal, automatically applying corrective actions to realign your infrastructure with its intended state. This feature not only reduces manual intervention but also enhances the stability and reliability of your systems.

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Orbital-State fully embraces the Infrastructure-as-Code paradigm, allowing you to define and manage your infrastructure through code. This methodology facilitates collaboration, version control, and repeatability, leading to more predictable and secure infrastructure deployment processes.
